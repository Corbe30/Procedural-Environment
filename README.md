# Procedural-Environment

"In computing, procedural generation is a method of creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated assets and algorithms coupled with computer-generated randomness and processing power. In computer graphics, it is commonly used to create textures and 3D models." - Wikipedia

The project will use three.js to procedurally generate the landscape, textures and trees; with sliders to manipulate the map in real time.
It will also support viewing the environment in different weathers/seasons.
